## üìó Wiki
For detailed information on configuration, themes, sources, and download client integration check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki).

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybinds

Like modal text editors such as Vim, there are several modes. Each have their own keybinds, which can be found out by pressing `F1` or `?` while in that mode. Some of the important ones are:

- <kbd>hjkl</kbd> or arrow keys for general navigation
- <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>i</kbd> to search
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>s</kbd> to change sources
- <kbd>d</kbd> to change download client
- <kbd>c</kbd> to change category
- <kbd>s</kbd> to change sort (<kbd>S</kbd> for reverse sort)
- <kbd>f</kbd> to change filter
- <kbd>t</kbd> to change theme
- <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd>, <kbd>h</kbd> for next and previous page
- <kbd>q</kbd> to quit

For a list of all modes and their respective keybinds, check [Keybinds](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki/Keybinds) on the wiki.

## üåê Proxies

If either `nyaa.si` or `torrentgalaxy` is not accessible in your region, try one of the proxies ([nyaa proxies](https://nyaatorrents.info/#proxy), [TorrentGalaxy proxies](https://torrends.to/proxy/torrentgalaxy)). Once you find one that works, replace the value for `base_url` in the source config with the working proxy url. For `nyaa`, I would recommend `nyaa.land`, as it is very compatible, and usually working. Here's what the config for `nyaa.land` would look like:

```toml
[source.nyaa]
base_url = 'nyaa.land'
```

If you have your own proxy setup, you use it by adding:

```toml
request_proxy = "localhost:8118"
```

to the top of your config. Replace the value with the IP and port for your proxy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The location of the config file for linux is:

```
~/.config/nyaa/config.toml
```

and on windows is

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\nyaa\config\config.toml
```

### Default Config
```toml
theme = "Default"                # the theme to use by default
default_source = "Nyaa"          # the source to use by default
download_client = "qBittorrent"  # the download client to use by default
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"   # date format for results (unset by default)
request_proxy = "localhost:8118" # request proxy for sending requests through (unset by default)
timeout = 30                     # request timeout for sources and clients (measured in seconds)
scroll_padding = 6               # scroll padding for results table
save_config_on_change = true     # save config when changing sources/themes


[source.nyaa]
# ...

[source.torrentgalaxy]
# ...

[client.cmd]
# ...

# ...
```

`theme` refers to the theme selected by default when the app is opened. Possible values are `Default`, `Dracula`, `Gruvbox`, or `Catppuccin Macchiato`. You can also use custom [user-defined themes](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki/User%E2%80%90defined-Themes).

`default_source` refers to the source selected by default once the app is opened. Possible values are `Nyaa`, `TorrentGalaxy`, or `Sukebei`. Each source has its own configuration. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki#sources) for more information on each sources config.

`download_client` refers to the download client selected by default once the app is opened. Each download client has its own configuration. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki#download-clients) for more information on each download clients config.
