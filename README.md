## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybinds
Like modal text editors such as Vim, there are several modes. Each have their own keybinds, which can be found out by pressing `F1` or `?` while in that mode. Some of the important ones are:
- `hjkl` or arrow keys for general navigation
- `/` or `i` to search
- `c` to open category popup
- `s` to open sort popup
- `f` to open filter popup
- `t` to open theme popup
- `n`, `p` or `l`, `h` for next and previous page
- `q` to quit

For a list of all modes and their respective keybinds, check [Keybinds](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki/Keybinds) on the wiki.

## üåê Proxies
If `nyaa.si` is not accessible in your region, try one of the [proxies](https://nyaatorrents.info/#proxy). Once you find one that works, replace the value for `base_url` in the default config with the working proxy url. I would recommend `nyaa.land`, as it is very compatible, and usually working. Here's what the config for `nyaa.land` would look like:
```toml
base_url = 'nyaa.land'
```

If you have your own proxy setup, you use it by adding:
```toml
request_proxy = "localhost:8118"
```
to your config.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The location of the config file for linux is:

`~/.config/nyaa/config.toml`

and on windows is

`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\nyaa\config\config.toml`

```toml
default_category = "AllCategories"
default_filter = "NoFilter"
default_sort = "Date"
default_search = ""
theme = "Default"
source = "NyaaHtml"
download_client = "transmission"
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
base_url = "https://nyaa.si/"
request_proxy = "localhost:8118" # None by default
timeout = 30

# ... client configurations
```

`default_category` refers to the category selected by default when the app is opened. Possible values are defined in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki/Category-Values).

`default_filter` refers to the filter selected by default when the app is opened. Possible values are `NoFilter`, `NoRemakes`, `TrustedOnly` or `Batches`.

`default_sort` refers to the sort selected by default when the app is opened. Possible values are `Date`, `Downloads`, `Seeders`, `Leechers`, or `Size`.

`default_search` refers to the search entered once the app is opened.

`theme` refers to the theme selected by default when the app is opened. Possible values are `Default`, `Dracula`, `Gruvbox`, or `Catppuccin Macchiato`. Custom themes coming soon!

`source` refers to the source selected by default once the app is opened. Possible values are `NyaaHtml` and `NyaaRss`.

`download_client` refers to the download client selected by default once the app is opened. Possible values are defined in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Beastwick18/nyaa/wiki)

`date_format` refers to the formatting of the dates in the Date column of the results table. Refer to [chrono's documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html) for information on how to format the date.

`base_url` refers to the url used to make requests. Change this to any nyaa mirror url in the format: `http(s)://nyaa.si` or `nyaa.si`

`request_proxy` refers to the url to proxy request through. This is not to be confused with *nyaa* proxies, which are defined with `base_url`.

`timeout` refers to how long the program will wait for a search request before it times out. This value is measured in seconds. You may want to increase this if your request times are usually long.
